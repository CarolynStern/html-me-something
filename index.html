          <h2>Marble, CO</h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in St. Louis, MO. Although my family took frequent, short trips to Florida and other various places, our home-base has always been St. Louis. When I was a senior in highschool, I was feeling an urge for adventure. I was really interested in backpacking and camping and wanted to learn more about survival skills and thru-hiking. I signed up for an Outward Bound trip which would take me on a 15 day backpacking trip through the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Our final destination on this trip was Marble, CO, where we got to see the old mill on the side of the river. The trip was a huge challenge for me. My pack was 60 lbs and my feet were constantly wet, but it was a formative trip for my future. I realized I loved the mountains and decided I wanted to move to Colorado while on the hike. The beauty of the mountains aroumd Marble was something I had never experienced before and I was excited to start a new chapter of my life closer to the Rockies.

          <h2>Fort Collins, CO</h2>
            <p>
              After my backpacking trip through Marble, I decided that I wanted to go to college in Colorado so I could be closer to the mountains. Upon visiting for the first time, I realized Fort Collins is like a dreamworld. Walt Disney actually modeled Disneyland's Main St. after Old Town in Fort Collins. The city is lined with quaint houses on large streets that are very bicycle friendly. Almost everyone in town rides a bicycle. I started college at Colorado State University in the fall of 2012. I fell in love with the town and had a great 4 years living there. I made some lifelong friends who were more than willing to accompany me on excursions into the mountains.

          <h2>Paros, Greece</h2>
            <p>
              During my time at Colorado State, I decided I wanted to take a semester to study abroad. I was a painting major and I wanted to go somewhere that was historically known for art and culture. I decided on Greece after I found a small art school located on the Cycladic island of Paros in the Aegean Sea. Paros is a small island, with only about 12,000 total inhabitants. On the hills above the port you can see windmills in all directions and the hills are covered with native herbs and wildflowers. It's a beautiful, peaceful place and was a perfect site for painting. I traveled to Athens, Crete and other islands during my time abroad but while I was there, I considered Paros home.

          <h2>Istanbul, Turkey</h2>
            <p>
              During my time in Greece, we traveled on weekends to other islands or back to Athens. At the end of the semester, the whole school took a trip to Istanbul, Turkey. Being in Istanbul was truly a culture shock. I felt like I had never been further from home which was the truth. I really enjoyed myself though. There was so much to look at, taste, smell and hear. It was like a sensory overload. I had some of the best food of my life that week. We also got to see sites like The Hagia Sofia and The Blue Mosque. It was a gorgeous city with so much to see, but when it was over, I found myself anxious to head back to Paros.

          <h2>Samara, Costa Rica</h2>
            <p>
              When I graduated CSU, I decided I wanted to go on a solo trip somewhere in the world. I had always wanted to explore Central America and thought it would be a great place for my first trip completely by myself. I flew down to Costa Rica with no agenda or plan, just my backpack. I was nervous upon arriving because I wasn't fluent in Spanish. I met some people in a hostel the first night who talked about a very cool small town on the Pacific coast of the country. I decided I would make my way to that side. I first traveled to Arenal, a volcano in the Northwest part of the country and after that, I went to Samara, the town I had heard about. It was an amazing place. The beaches were miles long and beautiful and the water was a bright blue almost like being in the Gulf of Mexico even though it was the Pacific Ocean. I ended up staying in Samara for two months and worked at hostel in order to live for free. I spent most of my days hiking around the area, seeing monkeys, crocodiles, and all types of tropical birds and swimming in the ocean. Living there was a dream and I will never forget how relaxing and serene that time in my life was.

          <h2>Granada, Nicaragua</h2>
            <p>
              After a couple months of Samara, I knew I had to move on and see other places. I decided to go north up into Nicaragua. I went to the Spanish, colonial city of Granada in the southern part of Nicaragua. The city is beautiful with its Spanish architecture. It's located on Lake Nicaragua with 360&#176 views of active and dormant volcanoes. I made a lot of friends while I was here, and got to practice my Spanish more than I was able to in Costa Rica. The locals were so nice to me. I made friends with some musicians and attended a lot of their concerts. I ended up staying in Granada for two months as well because I was having so much fun.

          <a name="Antigua, Guatemala"></a>
          <h2>Antigua, Guatemala</h2>
            <p>
              After staying a long time in Granada, I knew it was time to move on again so I slowly made my way north through the rest of Nicaragua, into El Salvador, and on up into Guatemala. I took my time on the way and would stay in some cities for a couple of days, but for the most part it felt like I was constantly on the move. Once I arrived in Guatemala, I traveled to Antigua, another beautfiul colonial city. Once there, I decided I wanted to get back to my roots of climbing mountains. I set out to hike the active volcano of Acatenango. It was a very steep incline. We gained about 3,000 ft in a day. At the top, we set up camp and when it got dark, we could see the lava from the adjacent volcano spewing. It was a crazy site to see lava erupting from the top of a volcano. In the morning, we woke before the sun and saw the most beautiful sunrise. The clouds were lower than the volcano and created the most beautiful color palette of purples, blues, pinks and yellows. Hiking Acatenango was a beautiful way to cap off my solo trip through Central America. Shortly after we arrived back in Antigua, I started making my way towards the capital city to head home to St. Louis, MO. It's been over a year since I returned and although I miss my travels constantly, it feels good to be back in the place I have always known as home.
